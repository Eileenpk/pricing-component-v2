## Overview
Hello this is my solution to the pricing component with toggle challenge, i did it using html5, css3 and javascript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt how to add JavaScript to the html, and how to use it to change some layout on the webpage!
Also learnt how to make the toggle master using only css.

### Continued development

JavaScript and CSS!
